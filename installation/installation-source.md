# Installing from source {#install-from-source}

Unless you have a special interest in compiling FreeLing, [installing it from a binary package](installation-packages.md) is recommended.

Installing FreeLing from source makes sense only in one of the following cases:
  - Provided packages are not installable in your distribution.
  - You want to use a development FreeLing version for which there is no binary package yet.
  - You want to modify or extend FreeLing.
  
To install from source, you need to follow three steps:

1. Download FreeLing source:
   This step is the same for all systems, and can be performed in two ways:
   
    * Go to [GitHub FreeLing Releases page](https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing/releases), download the source package (e.g. `FreeLing-4.1.tar.gz` or `FreeLing-4.1.zip`) and uncompress it in a folder of your choice.
    
    * Alternatively, clone FreeLing GitHub repository (either a stable version tag such as "v4.1", or the development version "master"). If you don't know what a git repository is, you probably should stick with the first option above.  

2. Install development tools and FreeLing dependencies:

   * [Install requirements on Linux](requirements-linux.md)
   * [Install requirements on Windows](requirements-windows.md)
   * [Install requirements on MacOS](requirements-mac.md)
 
3. Build FreeLing  

   * [Build FreeLing on Linux](installation-linux.md)
   * [Build FreeLing on Windows](installation-windows.md)
   * [Build FreeLing on MacOS](installation-mac.md)
